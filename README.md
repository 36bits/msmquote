# msmquote

**msmquote** is a Java application for updating current and historical security quotes and current currency exchange rates in Microsoft Money files.

Quote data can be updated for any security or currency where a quote is available from these currently supported sources:

* The [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) quote data API
* A Google Sheets spreadsheet with quote data provided by the [GOOGLEFINANCE](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093281) security information function
* Historical data for a single security from the Yahoo Finance historical quote data API
* Historical data for a single security from a CSV file generated by the Yahoo Finance historical quote data download facility

**msmquote** is compatible with the following versions of Microsoft Money:
* Microsoft Money 2004 (12.0)
* Microsoft Money 2005 (14.0)
* Microsoft Money Plus Sunset (17.0.120.3817)

# Getting Started
Download the latest **msmquote** [ZIP archive](https://github.com/36bits/msmquote/releases) and extract it to a suitable folder on your machine. Then run **msmquote** from the root of the extracted folder using the following command line:

`bin\java -jar msmquote-4.0.1.jar moneyfile.mny password source`

Where:
* `moneyfile.mny` is the Microsoft Money file that you wish to update (the file must not be open in Microsoft Money when **msmquote** is run)
* `password` is the file password if applicable (use `""` if the file is not password protected)
* `source` is the source of the quote data (full details of this parameter can be found in the [msmquote wiki](https://github.com/36bits/msmquote/wiki/Quote-Sources))
